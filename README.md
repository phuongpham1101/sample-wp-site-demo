# Sample WP Site for demo

The purpose of this project is for demo a basic WordPress site, focusing the homepage and event page.

This version is currently only not responsive, the design is for desktop only.

There is a custom post type called `event`. The event page is linked to the `Insights` item in the primary menu. The event cards are styled differently depends on the availability of the event itself (e.g. is it in the past or in the future).

### Potential Improvements

- A filter for event page that can filter based on a range of dates.
- Responsive work
